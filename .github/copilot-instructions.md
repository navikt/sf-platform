This is a monorepo containing multiple unlocked Salesforce packages. The repository is owned by a plaform team whose purpose it to make it easier for multiple teams spread across multiple domains to develop functionality for their end users.

The code inside the src and src-temp folder is written in apex and lightning web components.

The folder .github contains all our GitHub actions and workflows.

Do not use SFDX CLI commands only SF CLI commands, SFDX CLI is deprecated.

Prettier is used for styling and our prettier settings are described in .prettierrc

Always focus on security and sharing.

Give feedback if the code is starting to get comlpex and need to be simplified.

When writing tests:
Tests are defined by the @IsTest annotation.
Always include System.Test.startTest(); and System.Test.stopTest();. First we prepare the data. The actual test should be placed in side start and stop test. Then we confirm the test results with asserts.
When writing tests, the class we're testing often has the same filename as the test class except "Test"
