# Instructions for sf-platform

This is a repo for multiple unlocked Salesforce packages

We write most of our code in apex and lightning web components

We use the styles outlined in the Prettier file .prettierrc and using Salesforce we prefer single quotes over double quotes

We use Flxble with the sfp CLI
We use Salesforce CLI with the sf commands, not the deprecated sfdx commands

When writing comments for classes and methods, use the @description tag

Comments should include the @author tag and the name of the developer, xample "@author John Doe" based on the user.name in git Config

In comments the since tag should be written like this "@since version, current month current year" example: @since 0.1.0, March 2025
